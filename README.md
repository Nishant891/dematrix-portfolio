# Adding Articles

Place your articles as **Markdown (.md)** files inside the `content/` directory.

You can also create subfolders inside `content/` and the system will treat them as categories.
For example:

```
content/
  linux/
    permissions.md
  networking/
    osi-layer.md
  my-article.md
```

Each Markdown file will be automatically detected and rendered.

That's it — write, save, and your articles show up instantly.

```
```
